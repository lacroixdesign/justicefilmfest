Lyndsay always knew she wanted to make people laugh or be a Harlem Globetrotter when she grew up. After her hoop dreams died in the 8th grade, she started focusing on the first one. She runs her own copywriting shop and her editorial work can be seen at Above Average, Hello Giggles, and The Everygirl. A student at Improv Olympic in Chicago, her passions include wine and wordplay (together or apart) and her dream jobs include writing for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon or somehow becoming Mindy Kaling's roommate and best friend.
