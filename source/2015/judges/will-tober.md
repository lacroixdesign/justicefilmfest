Will Tober is a co-founder of Kindred Image and the Producer of the award-winning documentary, The Drop Box. While completing his BA in Broadcast Journalism at the University of Southern California he was invited to take a trip to Seoul, South Korea to film a documentary. Never one to turn down an adventure, Will made the trip and spent a week living with Pastor Lee and his family. After returning home, he decided to forgo his dreams of becoming a sports broadcaster and dedicate himself to providing a better life for the children that changed his life forever.
