Dan Haseltine is the Co-Founder and Director of Artist Relationships at Blood:Water. When he was a child he believed he was a Jedi, would someday befriend an Extra Terrestrial, and would eventually learn to fly. Although none of these things have happened, he still believes in the power of a great story and the value of great storytellers.
